# requirement-analysis

This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase for a **Booking Management System**. The goal is to create a structured blueprint of requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria to guide software development effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of **identifying, documenting, and analyzing the needs of a system** before development begins. It ensures that developers, stakeholders, and users share a clear understanding of the project’s goals and functionalities.  

**Key Points:**  
- Converts business needs into technical specifications.  
- Minimizes project risks by clarifying expectations early.  
- Serves as a foundation for design, development, and testing.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Ensures clarity and alignment:** Helps all stakeholders understand what the system must achieve.  
2. **Reduces errors and rework:** Well-analyzed requirements prevent misinterpretations that can cause delays or added costs.  
3. **Supports scalability and maintainability:** Clear requirements guide architecture decisions and future enhancements.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and documentation.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Asking questions, conducting interviews, and observing workflows to uncover hidden needs.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Writing clear, structured specifications that describe system behavior and features.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Organizing, prioritizing, and validating requirements, often using diagrams and models.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that requirements meet business goals and are feasible, testable, and unambiguous.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define **what the system should do**. Examples for the booking system:  
- Users can search for available rooms by date and location.  
- Users can complete a booking with payment integration.  
- Admins can add or remove properties.  

### Non-functional Requirements
These define **how the system performs**. Examples for the booking system:  
- System response time should be under 2 seconds for searches.  
- Data must be encrypted during transmission.  
- The platform should handle 500 concurrent users.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent **actors and system interactions**. They help identify who interacts with the system and the main functionalities.

**Actors:** Users, Admins  
**Use Cases:** Search Listings, Book Room, Make Payment, Manage Listings

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define **conditions that must be met** for a feature to be considered complete and acceptable.  

**Example – Checkout Feature:**  
- Users must be able to enter valid payment details.  
- Payment must be processed securely.  
- Confirmation email is sent to the user upon successful booking.  
- System should prevent double booking for the same room and time.
